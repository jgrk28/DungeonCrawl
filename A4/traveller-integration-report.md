SUBJECT: Traveller server module implementation 

Upon reviewing the implementation provided for the Traveller server module, we have concluded that the specification was implemented moderately well. While the implementors did not exclude or omit any of the functionality mentioned in our original specification, they did make a number of additions. For example, they overrode the equals and hashcode methods for both the Character and Town classes. While we did not expect that these methods would be overridden, it will be especially helpful when integrating with our client module. 

These additions also included the creation of a TownNetwork class. Some of the methods we specified (createCharacter and createTown) return Character and Town objects. In order to properly implement these methods, the addition of this class was justified. The TownNetwork class also stores the network itself, which was an oversight in the original specification. We recognized this oversight when working on our client module, and added functionality to store the network in the client. This means there was some duplication of work, as we did not assume the implementor would add this class. However, it does means we have the necessary functionality when integrating, regardless of whether we use their TownNetwork class or our original design for the client. 

They also made important additions to the town class, which initially did not include the ability for a town to keep track of which characters were located there. We believe this addition was justified as well. However, we did draw issue with a number of public methods that were added to this class. This includes charactersPresent, removeCharacter, and addCharacter. These methods were not mentioned in our specification, and we believe that other design choices could have been made in order to have these as private methods. 

We believe that we would be able to integrate the received implementation with our client module from warm-up 3 relatively easily. Some changes would be needed given the unanticipated additions, such as the TownNetwork class and the overridden equals method. In addition to refactoring our code to include these additions, we would also need to spend some time ensuring that everything operates as intended and potentially fixing bugs. Realistically, we expect this would require 1-2 hours of effort. 

Based on the implementation we received, there are a number of things we could have improved. We could have been more specific about the parameters methods accept and return, any relevant errors a given method may throw, and considered data structures that would simplify the implementation. We could have specifically requested that the implementors overrode both equals and hashcode, which would have saved us time for the client implementation. We also could have done a better job of considering the larger picture. Not including a class to track the town network was a considerable oversight on our part, and our specification could have encouraged cleaner design and modularity. There is an opportunity here to take the “plan top-down” approach to heart, which would serve us well in similar assignments moving forward.
