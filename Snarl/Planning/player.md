## PlayerClient ##

The PlayerClient is a class that runs on the user's side of the TCP connection. This displays relevant information to the user, and sends moves and other commands that the user would like to perform in the game to the GameManager. The GameManager sends the game state specific to the user. This includes what the user can see in the level, if they are still in the active level, and whether or not the game is over.
